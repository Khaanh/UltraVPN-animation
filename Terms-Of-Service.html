          <h2>1. What services does UltaVPN provide?</h2>

          <p>A VPN, plus a bunch of other services that all have to do with privacy and security.</p>
          <p>Surfshark provides virtual private network (VPN) services, also other privacy and cyber security related services (“Services”). Services include, but are not limited to VPN software, extensions, applications and other related services. A VPN is a secure way to protect your online activities by encrypting your data connection.

With Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your location.</p>

          <p>No-logs Policy is one of the most important features of our Services.

We do not collect IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic and other similar data.

Moreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide Services to you. More information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at https://surfshark.com/privacy-policy. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
